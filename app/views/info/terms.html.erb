Any Member wishing to book Accommodations included in Listings with such requirements must meet these requirements. More information on how to set such requirements is available via the "Hosting" section of the Site, Application and Services.<br>
        If you are a Host, Room N House makes certain tools available to you to help you to make informed decisions about which Members you choose to confirm for booking for your Accommodation. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Host, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who reside at or are otherwise present at the Accommodation at your request or invitation, excluding the Guest (and the individuals the Guest invites to the Accommodation, if applicable.)<br>
        Room N House recommends that Hosts obtain appropriate insurance for their Accommodations. Please review any insurance policy that you may have for your Accommodation carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Guests (and the individuals the Guest invites to the Accommodation, if applicable) while at your Accommodation.</p>
        <h3>NO ENDORSEMENT</h3>
        <p>Room N House does not endorse any Members or any Accommodations. In addition, although these Terms require Members to provide accurate information, we do not attempt to confirm, and do not confirm, any Member’s purported identity. You are responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others who you contact via the Site, Application and Services. Except as provided in the Room N House Host Guarantee Terms and Conditions ("Room N House Host Guarantee"), which is an agreement between Room N House and Hosts, we will not be responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your interactions with other Members. (Please see Room N House’s Host Guarantee Terms and Conditions at www.roomnhouse.com/terms for information about the Room N House Host Guarantee.) By using the Site, Application or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm and you agree not to attempt to impose liability on, or seek any legal remedy from Room N House with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Members on the Site and Services regarding any bookings or Listings made by you.</p>
        <h3>BOOKINGS AND FINANCIAL TERMS</h3>
        <h3>BOOKINGS AND FINANCIAL TERMS FOR HOSTS</h3>
        <p>If you are a Host and a booking is requested for your Accommodation via the Site, Application and Services, you will be required to either confirm or reject the booking within 24 hours of when the booking is requested (as determined by Room N House in its sole discretion) or the booking request will be automatically cancelled. When a booking is requested via the Site, Application and Services, we will share with you (i) the first and last name of the Guest who has requested the booking, (ii) a link to the Guest’s Room N House Account profile page, (iii) the names of any members of an SNS with whom you are "friends" or associated on the SNS if such individuals are also "friends" or associated with the Guest on such SNS, and (iv) an indication that the name that the Guest provided to Room N House when the Guest became a Member matches the name that the Guest provided to the SNSs to which the Guest has linked his or her Room N House Account, so that you can view such information before confirming or rejecting the booking. If you are unable to confirm or decide to reject a booking of an Accommodation within such 24 hour period, any amounts collected by Room N House for the requested booking will be refunded to the applicable Guest’s credit or debit card and any pre-authorization of such credit or debit card will be released. When you confirm a booking requested by a Guest, Room N House will send you an email, text message or message via the Application confirming such booking, depending on the selections you make via the Site, Application and Services.
        The fees displayed in each Listing are comprised of the Accommodation Fees (defined below) and the Guest Fees (defined below.) Where applicable, Taxes may be charged in addition to the Accommodation Fees and Guest Fees. The Accommodation Fees, the Guest Fees and applicable Taxes are collectively referred to in these Terms as the "Total Fees". The amounts due and payable by a Guest solely relating to a Host’s Accommodation are the "Accommodation Fees". Please note that it is the Host and not Room N House which determines the Accommodation Fees. The Accommodation Fee may include a cleaning fee, at the Host’s discretion. Room N House charges a fee to Guests based upon a percentage of applicable Accommodation Fees which are the "Guest Fees". The Guest Fees are added to the Accommodation Fees to calculate the Total Fees (which will also include applicable Taxes) displayed in the applicable Listing. Room N House will collect the Total Fees at the time of booking confirmation (i.e. when the Host confirms the booking within 24 hours of the booking request) and will remit the Accommodation Fees (less Room N House’s Host Fees (defined below)) to the Host within 24 hours of when the Guest arrives at the applicable Accommodation.
        Please note that Room N House does not currently charge fees for the creation of Listings. However, you acknowledge and agree that Room N House reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge you for and collect fees from you for the creation of Listings. Please note that Room N House will provide notice of any Listing fee collection via the Site, Application and Services, prior to implementing such a Listing fee feature.
        </p>
        <h3>BOOKINGS AND FINANCIAL TERMS FOR GUESTS</h3>
        <p>The Hosts, not Room N House, are solely responsible for honouring any confirmed bookings and making available any Accommodations reserved through the Site, Application and Services. If you, as a Guest, choose to enter into a transaction with a Host for the booking of an Accommodation, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Host and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Accommodation imposed by the Host. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Room N House, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, and Room N House is not a party to such agreements and disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements.  Listings for Accommodations will specify the Total Fees. As noted above, the Host is required to either confirm or reject the booking within 24 hours of when the booking is requested (as determined by Room N House in its sole discretion) or the requested booking will be automatically cancelled. If a requested booking is cancelled (i.e. not confirmed by the applicable Host), any amounts collected by Room N House will be refunded to such Guest, depending on the selections the Guest makes via the Site and Application, and any pre-authorization of such Guest’s credit or debit card will be released, if applicable.
        You agree to pay Room N House for the Total Fees for any booking requested in connection with your Room N House Account if such requested bookings are confirmed by the applicable Host. In order to establish a booking pending the applicable Host’s confirmation of your requested booking, you understand and agree that Room N House reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization via your credit or debit card for the Total Fees or (ii) charge your credit or debit card a nominal amount, not to exceed fifty rupees (INR 50), or a similar sum in the currency in which you are transacting ( e.g. one euro or one British pound) to verify your credit or debit card. Once Room N House receives confirmation of your booking from the applicable Host, Room N House will collect the Total Fees in accordance with the terms and conditions of these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Listing. Please note that Room N House cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Guest by his or her bank related to Room N House’s collection of the Total Fees, and Room N House disclaims all liability in this regard.
        In connection with your requested booking, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit or debit card information either to Room N House or its third party payment processor. You agree to pay Room N House for any confirmed bookings made in connection with your Room N House Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the Site or Application – e.g. by PayPal or credit or debit card. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit or debit card provided as part of requesting the booking, either directly by Room N House or indirectly, via a third party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Site or Application. You also authorize Room N House to charge your credit or debit card in the event of damage caused at an Accommodation as contemplated under "Damage to Accommodations" below and for Security Deposits, if applicable. If you are directed to Room N House’s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. Once your confirmed booking transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking.
        </p>
        <h3>SECURITY DEPOSITS</h3>
        <p>Hosts may choose to include security deposits in their Listings ("Security Deposits"). Each Listing will describe whether a Security Deposit is required for the applicable Accommodation. If a Security Deposit is included in a Listing for a confirmed booking of Accommodation, Room N House will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a pre-authorization of the Guest’s credit or debit card in the amount the Host determines for the Security Deposit within a reasonable time prior to the Guest’s check-in at the applicable Host’s Accommodation. Room N House will also use its commercially reasonable efforts to address Hosts’ requests and claims related to Security Deposits, but Room N House is not responsible for administering or accepting any claims by Hosts related to Security Deposits, and disclaims any and all liability in this regard.</p>
        <h3>SERVICE FEES</h3>
        <p>In consideration for providing the Services, Room n House collects service fees from Hosts and Guests ("Service Fees"). Service Fees are made up of two (2) components: (i) Guest Fees and (ii) a fee that is charged to the Host based upon a percentage of the amount of the Accommodation Fees ("Host Fees"). Where applicable, Taxes may also be charged in addition to the Host Fees. Host Fees are deducted from the Accommodation Fees before remitting the Accommodation Fees to the Host, within 24 hours of when the Guest arrives at the applicable Accommodation. Guest Fees are, as noted above, included in the Total Fees.
        Balances will be remitted to Hosts via check, PayPal, direct deposit or other payment methods described on the Site or via the Application, in the Host’s currency of choice, depending upon the selections the Host makes via the Site, Application and Services. Please note that for any payments by Room N House in currencies other than INDIAN RUPEES, Room N House may deduct foreign currency processing costs from such payments. Except as otherwise provided herein, Service Fees are non-refundable.
        </p>
        <h3>GENERAL BOOKING AND FINANCIAL TERMS</h3>
        <h3>CANCELLATIONS AND REFUNDS</h3>
        <p>If, as a Guest, you cancel your requested booking before the requested booking is confirmed by a Host, Room N House will refund any Accommodation Fees collected for such requested booking within a commercially reasonable time. If, as a Guest, you wish to cancel a confirmed booking made via the Site, Application and Services, the cancellation policy of the Host contained in the applicable Listing will apply to such cancellation.

        <p>Some Hosts may pledge to donate a portion of the funds they receive from confirmed bookings made via the Site, Application and Services to a particular cause or charity. We do not control, and will not take any responsibility or liability for, whether the Host does in fact make the donation he or she pledged to make.</p>
        <h3>TAXES</h3>
        <p>You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining your applicable Tax reporting requirements in consultation with your tax advisors.

        <h3>DAMAGE TO ACCOMMODATIONS</h3>
        <p>As a Guest, you are responsible for leaving the Accommodation in the condition it was in when you arrived. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Guest, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who you invite to, or otherwise provide access to, the Accommodation. In the event that a Host claims otherwise and provides evidence of damage, including but not limited to, photographs, you agree to pay the cost of replacing the damaged items with equivalent items. After being notified of the claim and given forty eight (48) hours to respond, the payment will be charged to and taken from the credit or debit card on file in your Room N House Account. Room N House also reserves the right to charge the credit or debit card on file in your Room N House Account, or otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any avenues available to Room N House in this regard, including using Security Deposits, in situations in which you have been determined, in Room N House’s sole discretion, to have damaged any Accommodation, including, but not limited to, in relation to any payment requests made by Hosts under the Room N House Host Guarantee, and in relation to any payments made by Room N House to Hosts.

        Both Guests and Hosts agree to cooperate with and assist Room N House in good faith, and to provide Room N House with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Room N House, in connection with any complaints or claims made by Members relating to Accommodations or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including, without limitation, payment requests made under the Room N House Host Guarantee) or with respect to any investigation undertaken by Room N House or a representative of Room N House regarding use or abuse of the Site, Application or the Services. If you are a Guest, upon Room N House’s reasonable request, and to the extent you are reasonably able to do so, you agree to participate in mediation or similar resolution process with a Host, at no cost to you, which process will be conducted by Room N House or a third party selected by Room N House, with respect to losses for which the Host is requesting payment from Room N House under the Room N House Host Guarantee.
        If you are a Guest, you understand and agree that Room N House reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to make a claim under your homeowner’s, renter’s or other insurance policy related to any damage or loss that you may have caused or been responsible for to an Accommodation or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation. You agree to cooperate with and assist Room N House in good faith, and to provide Room N House with such information as may be reasonably requested by Room N House in order to make a claim under your homeowner’s, renter’s or other insurance policy, including, but not limited to, executing documents and taking such further acts as Room N House may reasonably request to assist Room N House in accomplishing the foregoing.
